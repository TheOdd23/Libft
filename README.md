# Libft

First project of 42's common core. The goal was to built our own function library in C and learning about Makefiles at the same time.

Since most of the functions are already existing C functions, it was interesting to reimagine them, trying to understand how they work and how to make them.

In 42's learning spirit, these were most of the time, part of the only functions that were allowed in the subsequent projects, so understanding their purpose and making them "bulletproof" was super important. 

Here's a list of some of those functions:

For the bonus part, we had to learn about linked lists since the goal was to make functions that manipulate them.
